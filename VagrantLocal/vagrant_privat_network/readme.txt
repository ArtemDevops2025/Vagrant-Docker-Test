Key Differences in Vagrantfile

    Docker Image:

        The original Vagrantfile uses a custom image (datascientest/base:latest), which may have been misconfigured or incompatible with your setup.

        The current Vagrantfile uses the official ubuntu:latest image, which is more reliable and widely supported.

    Volume Mounting:

        Both Vagrantfiles include the create_args option to mount /sys/fs/cgroup. However, in the current setup, this is not strictly necessary because the Dockerfile no longer relies on systemd.

3. Why the Current Configuration Works

    Simplified and Minimal: The current Dockerfile and Vagrantfile are simpler and focus only on the essentials (SSH access and port forwarding). This reduces the chances of misconfiguration.

    No Systemd Dependency: The current setup avoids systemd-specific configurations, making it compatible with non-systemd environments like your Debian system.

    Correct CMD Instruction: The CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"] ensures that the container stays running and allows Vagrant to connect via SSH.

4. Recommendations

    If you need additional packages (e.g., git, curl), you can add them to the Dockerfile, but keep the configuration minimal to avoid issues.

    If you encounter further issues, check the Docker logs (docker logs server_web) and ensure that the SSH service is running inside the container.
